# videoChatApp-Practice


This repo was created as a learning area for myself to learn how to create a video chat application using WebRTC, Firebase, HTML and CSS
I will be taking notes on things i've learned watching tutorials and documentation as I continue learning. The end result will look like a functional video chat app
